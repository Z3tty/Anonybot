# Anonybot
Wanna share confessions anonymously? Just setup and DM the bot!
Write your discord bot token to the empty token file, and run the main.py script.

Use ?designate in the channel where you want anonymous messages to appear, and dm the bot to add messages to the queue
Timeouts are controlled by the TIMEOUT global, set it to your preference.

Currently, each server would require its own instance of Anonybot since submissions are handled via DM. If you have multiple servers you wish to use the bot in, you may
add them all to a "pool" of anon-channels that the bot mass-messages the same submissions to.
